Reviewing all the work prior to today.
Cut the samples acc. to (z_lens > 0.05) and (z_src - z_lens > 0.1)
Created directory w/in csv files labeled "latest"
Most recent data as of beginning of session:
    links_autoz_sample_latest.csv (links_autoz_sample_061520) (56 rows, 52 unique candidates)
    links_knabel_autoz_sample_latest.csv (...061520) (7 rows, 6 unique candidates)
    li_autoz_sample_latest.csv (...061520) (8 rows, 8 unique candidates)
Most recent data following end of session:
    links_sample_latest_len42.csv (42 rows, 40 unique candidates)
    links_knabel_sample_len7.csv (7 rows, 6 unique candidates)
    li_sample_len3.csv (3 unique candidates)
Notes:
    I have not determined how I will choose one of the duplicates over the other.

Working with final two duplicates in LinKS candidates. Simple to cut.
Most recent data following session:
	links_sample_latest_len40
	links_knabel_sample_len7
	li_sample_len3
Notes:
	I intend to combine the notebooks and visualizations and begin writing.

Consolidated work to a master notebook. Got through the most recent selection.
Most recent data following session:
	links_sample_latest_len40
	links_knabel_sample_len7
	li_sample_len3
Next step to pull the visualization pieces into the master notebook.
Notes:
    Check those data against the ones saved in the latest folder earlier today.
        All candidates should be the same... hopefully I got the Lambdar stuff 
        right the first time

Consolidated visualization code to master notebok.
Looked at two LinKS candidates that appear to fall within the selection parameter space used by Holwerda-15... One of them passes, and I have no idea why it wasn't selected in the paper.
It could have been on an alias... All candidates, old and new, near the alias of
(1+z)/(1+z2)=1.343±0.002 (∼5007/3727) or the inversewere removed from the sample.
For this candidate, the result is 1.344, which shows that it was removed by happenstance. With a log(mass) ~ 11.2 and redshift 0.22, it falls right at the overlap between spec and mac in the Knabel-2020 paper. Interesting!
Discuss with Benne the relevant info to focus on.
