Reviewing all the work prior to today.
Cut the samples acc. to (z_lens > 0.05) and (z_src - z_lens > 0.1)
Created directory w/in csv files labeled "latest"
Most recent data as of beginning of session:
    links_autoz_sample_latest.csv (links_autoz_sample_061520) (56 rows, 52 unique candidates)
    links_knabel_autoz_sample_latest.csv (...061520) (7 rows, 6 unique candidates)
    li_autoz_sample_latest.csv (...061520) (8 rows, 8 unique candidates)
Most recent data following end of session:
    links_sample_latest_len42.csv (42 rows, 40 unique candidates)
    links_knabel_sample_len7.csv (7 rows, 6 unique candidates)
    li_sample_len3.csv (3 unique candidates)
Notes:
    I have not determined how I will choose one of the duplicates over the other.

1/15/21
Working with final two duplicates in LinKS candidates. Simple to cut.
Most recent data following session:
	links_sample_latest_len40
	links_knabel_sample_len7
	li_sample_len3
Notes:
	I intend to combine the notebooks and visualizations and begin writing.   
    
1/15/21
Consolidated work to a master notebook. Got through the most recent selection.
Most recent data following session:
	links_sample_latest_len40
	links_knabel_sample_latest_len6
	li_sample_latest_len3
Next step to pull the visualization pieces into the master notebook.
Notes:
    Check those data against the ones saved in the latest folder earlier today.
        All candidates should be the same... hopefully I got the Lambdar stuff 
        right the first time

Consolidated visualization code to master notebok.
Looked at two LinKS candidates that appear to fall within the selection parameter space used by Holwerda-15... One of them passes, and I have no idea why it wasn't selected in the paper.
It could have been on an alias... All candidates, old and new, near the alias of
(1+z)/(1+z2)=1.343±0.002 (∼5007/3727) or the inversewere removed from the sample.
For this candidate, the result is 1.344, which shows that it was removed by happenstance. With a log(mass) ~ 11.2 and redshift 0.22, it falls right at the overlap between spec and mac in the Knabel-2020 paper. Interesting!
Discuss with Benne the relevant info to focus on.

Notebook: 011921_correlation_tests
Applying tests of correlation for output parameters from autoz and lens scores.
In master notebook, CNN prob is incorrectly merged. Change that!
Ran spearman, pearson and kendall tau tests on the scores and cnn probability output to sigma2 and R. Scores were not well-correlated at all. CNN probability output was ~0.25, but there are a couple outliers. It may be useful to bootstrap and check again.

Notebook: 011021_correlation_tests
Fitted linear regression to the parameters. 
Very weak correlations, but I at least have some numbers to it. 
Ran some bootstrapping tests to see about uncertainties and get more info on how outliers affect it... Not sure how to do all of that properly. Emailed Benne. I used the result of the fit and put the uncertainty as +/- the std from the bootstrapping.
Added these results to the paper.
Still need to fix CNN prob merging in master notebook and put correlation studies in the master as well.

1/21/21
Updated master notebook with the correlation studies and visualizations.
Also removed a LinKS candidate whose probability of redshift success in autoz was very low.
This forced me to redo the correlation studies, which changed the numbers slightly. No change in outcome.
Looked at the z-lens redshift outputs for Li candidates against Li photo-z, which are inconsistent for two of the three. Will need to make a decision there. I need to check the z-src as well.
